# Cost-Calculator
# This program is designed to take in user inputs for the type of service required: house cleaning or yard service
# If the user selects house cleaning, they will be prompted to enter the number of rooms needing to be cleaned and the type of cleaning
# If the user selects yard service, they will be prompted to enter the SqFt of the yard, the linear feet of the yard, and the number of shrubs
# The last prompt will be to enter if they are eligible for a senior discount
# It will then send inputs to the appropriate function to calculate total cost based off the fixed costs for services selected
